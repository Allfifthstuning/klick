2008-08-11: Version 0.8.0

 * Added basic OSC support.
 * Added interactive mode (klick -i).

2008-05-24: Version 0.7.0

 * New default sound (square wave).
 * Allow volume and pitch of emphasized and normal beats to be adjusted
   individually.
 * Provide samples as regular wave files, rather than compiling them into the
   executable.
 * Some source code restructuring.

2008-04-08: Version 0.6.3

 * Fixed a bug that caused klick to play at a slightly wrong tempo when using
   silent beats (with the pattern feature).
 * Made klick compile cleanly with -W -Wall.

2008-03-19: Version 0.6.2

 * Fixed a bug when using -E or -e and either -v or -w parameters at the same
   time.
 * Fixed (and actually documented) tempo-per-beat feature.
 * Use jack_client_open() instead of deprecated jack_client_new(), default
   client name is now simply "klick".

2008-02-02: Version 0.6.1

 * Fixed parsing of patterns on the command line.
 * Don't choke on tempo map entries where tempo == tempo2.

2008-01-27: Version 0.6

 * Fixed a segfault when changing the position via JACK transport.
 * Vastly more efficient seeking in the tempo map.
 * Fixed erroneous behaviour of JACK transport BBT slave mode (-j), and be a
   little more tolerant of faulty BBT information from the timebase master.
 * Try to send more sensible BBT information in timebase master mode.

2007-12-02: Version 0.5

 * Additional sound (bell/click).
 * Added option to auto-connect to hardware output ports.
 * Various minor fixes and enhancements, several changes under the hood.
 * Improved documentation.

2007-07-08: Version 0.4

 * JACK transport master support.
 * JACK transport slave support (running without tempomap).
 * Added ability to change the pitch of the click sounds.
 * Volume and tempo multipliers are now given as floats rather than percentage.
 * Hopefully more bugs fixed than newly introduced.

2007-03-26: Version 0.2

 * Some bugfixes.
 * Improved documentation.

2007-02-10: Version 0.1
